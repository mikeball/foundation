# Foundation/PG

A clojure data access library for postgresql.


Status: Work in Progress, hardly anything functional.




## Goals
  Focus on postgresql support only
  Easy to use correctly
  Support extended postgresql datatypes (eg arrays and json)


## Features
- automatic conversion from dash to underscore and back
- upper/lower casing is ignored, rather than automatically being lower cased.
- automatic conversion of java.time.Instant to java.sql.timestamp





## TODO/Questions

- unit test with-rs
- break param setting into different namespace
- clean up and unit test current functionality
+ map instants/timestamps
- sort out return from inserts that don't have generated keys
- handle insert of sequence of maps
- handle vector based insert format
- delete with where clause
- update with where clause


How to support postgres arrays as well as lists of items?




I wonder if we could do a select/diff and issue only changed columns as updates?
I wonder if we could check concurrency doing this as well?
Some sort of concurrency check system?





## Explicitly Not Included
Data definition sql and schema migrations. We believe that these concerns should
be handled outside of the data layer of your application and no plans to include
these into this library.
