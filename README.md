# Foundation/PG

A complete toolkit for talking to Postgres. A work in progress, but usable.

- Simple to run query sets and transaction sets.
- SQL templating similar to yesql
- Automatic conversion of datetime datatypes
- Integer and text array support
- JSON support (partial/pending)
- Multiple result set support
- Automatic conversion from dash to underscore and back
- Keyword case unchanged, rather than automatically converted to lower case.
- Connection pooling with the excellent [HikariCP](http://brettwooldridge.github.io/HikariCP/)



## Quick Start
```clojure

(require '[taoclj.foundation :as pg])

(pg/def-datasource examples-db {:host     "localhost"
                                :port     5432
                                :database "examples_db"
                                :username "examples_app"
                                :password "password"
                                :pooled   false })


; insert a record, returns generated key
(pg/trx-> examples-db
          (pg/insert :products {:name "product 1"}))
=> 1



; select all products
(pg/qry-> examples-db
          (pg/select :products {}))

=> ({:id 1, :name "product 1"})   ; * returns a list


; select a single record
(pg/qry-> examples-db
          (pg/select1 :products {:id 1}))

=> {:id 1, :name "product 1"}   ; * returns a single record


```

```sql
-- write more complex queries in sql template files
select p.id, p.name, c.name as category_name
  from products p
    inner join categories c on p.category_id = c.id
  where p.category_id = :category-id
```

```clojure

; define the query and reference the template file.
(def-query my-query
    {:file "path/to/my_query.sql"})

; use complex template queries
(pg/qry-> examples-db
          (my-query {:category-id 6}))

=> ({:id 1 :name "Product A" :category-name "Category 6"}
    {:id 2 :name "Product B" :category-name "Category 6"})

```

## Rationale

I simply wanted something as easy to use as Entity Framework for postgres, minus the ORM baggage. I wanted DateTime's handled automatically, and underscores converted to dashes. Also I really wanted a clean sytax structure for exectuting multiple queries at once, such as adding a parent and multiple child records. I wanted sensible result back based on outcome of query. None of the other clojure sql access libaries was quite what I desired.

After much experimentation, I concluded that insert, updates and very simple select statements are better handled using a datastructure DSL. This allow transparent handling of both single items as well as sequences of items, batch inserts, cuts down on number of templated queries we need to write and means we don't have to rely on function naming conventions for return values. For any query beyond the most trivial, I feel it's better to then use a templated query.

The primary goal is ease of use while also encouraging a correct path. I want to embrace postgres to fullest extent possible, and support postgresql extended datatypes (eg arrays, json, hstore, gis)

Why support only postgresql? Simply I've chosen to build first class support for 1 database rather than lowest common denominator support for all given limited time. Also a desire to out of the box map more complex types such as arrays & json, and also to support listen/notify.





## Intentionally Not Included

Support for other databases such as MySql, MS Sql, Oracle, etc.

Data definition sql and schema migrations. We believe that these concerns should
be handled outside of the data layer of your application and no plans to include
these into this library.
