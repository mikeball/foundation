Goals
  Focus on postgresql support only
  Easy to use correctly
  Support extended postgresql datatypes (eg arrays and json)


## Features
- automatic conversion from dash to underscore and back
- automatic conversion of java.time.Instant to java.sql.timestamp





## TODO/Questions

How to support postgres arrays as well as lists of items?


Is transparent pooling inclusion a good thing?
Should connection pooling be included by default?


I wonder if we could do a select/diff and issue only changed columns as updates?
I wonder if we could check concurrency doing this as well?
Some sort of concurrency check system?





## Explicitly Not Included
Data definition sql and schema migrations. We believe that these concerns should
be handled outside of the data layer of your application and no plans to include
these into this library.
